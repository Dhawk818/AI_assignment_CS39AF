# OmniAI Demo Text Backend (Flask)

This folder contains a small Python Flask API that simulates how the
OmniAI front-end (index.html + script.js) could talk to a backend
service similar to a small LLM.

- **File:** `omniai_api.py`
- **Endpoint:** `POST /api/chat` with JSON `{"message": "..."}`

It returns a simple, rule-based reply and some metadata. There is **no**
real language model here; it is intentionally offline and lightweight,
just to demonstrate the architecture.

## Running locally

```bash
pip install flask
cd backend
python omniai_api.py
